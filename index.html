        		<p>What is happening:<p>
			<p>I have started to finialize Fringecovery and it is now deployed. It is actually not bad. I had changed the fonts that it currently uses and also the login behind the copy and past functionalty. I stumbled across an excellent site that is fun. the site allows you to learn how to code in a different manner. It sets up scenarios where you have to code based on the input that you receive. I will update thesite name and address later. I have started down the path to learn Ruby on Rails and Python so that I can expand my repertoire of languages that I know.<p>
        	    <p>My technical support skills have been sharpened over my career. Helping people get along with technology through advice, training, or assisting them with thier technical difficulties. I have never enjoying this rewarding aspect of my life.</p>
                    <p>As a developer of automation tools and web-based solutions using JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL, I can break down and scope a problem or requirement, define features and functions and come up with unique solutions on budget.</p>
                    <p>My talents include completing a project using innovative methods, and entering into an already existing project, and assiting to take it into completion.</p>
                    <p>For my past time, I have taken up singing in a choir as a tenor along with my wife and I have started to look into taking up an instrucment once more. I also enjoy on occaision playing a few video games and watching movies with my wife.</p>
