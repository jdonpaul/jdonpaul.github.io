        		<p>What is happening:<p>
			<p>I have started to finialize Fringecovery and it is now deployed. It is actually not bad. I had changed the fonts that it currently uses and also the login behind the copy and past functionalty. I stumbled across an excellent site that is fun. the site allows you to learn how to code in a different manner. It sets up scenarios where you have to code based on the input that you receive. I will update thesite name and address later. I have started down the path to learn Ruby on Rails and Python so that I can expand my repertoire of languages that I know.<p>
