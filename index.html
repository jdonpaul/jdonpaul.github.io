        	    <p>My technical support skills have been sharpened over my career. Helping people get along with technology through advice, training, or assisting them with thier technical difficulties. I have never enjoying this rewarding aspect of my life.</p>
                    <p>As a developer of automation tools and web-based solutions using JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL, I can break down and scope a problem or requirement, define features and functions and come up with unique solutions on budget.</p>
                    <p>My talents include completing a project using innovative methods, and entering into an already existing project, and assiting to take it into completion.</p>
                    <p>For my past time, I have taken up singing in a choir as a tenor along with my wife and I have started to look into taking up an instrucment once more. I also enjoy on occaision playing a few video games and watching movies with my wife.</p>
